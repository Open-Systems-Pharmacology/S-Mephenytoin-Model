A PBPK model describing the limited set of in vivo p.o. data could be established.

Population simulated data had a comparable variability with the observed data when included additional variability for CYP2C19 expression. Moreover, the mean data from other studies ([Jacqz 1986](#5-references), [Wedlund 1985](#5-references)) were in the range of expected variability, confirming the adequacy of the model.
